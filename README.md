This is the YARoRA: Yet Another Ruby on Rails Application.

It is built on the Rails v6.1 and utilizes Bootstrap/Material via Webpacker. It should be a nice little
configuration/template to spawn additional projects.

## Done

* Basic Application
* Webpacker
* StimulusJS
* Bootstrap with Material

## Missing

* Authentication and Authorization
